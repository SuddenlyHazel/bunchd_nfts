# Bunchd NFT Alpha Onboarding

We're excited to get you all setup with your own Bunchd NFT Canister. As a quick reminder, this is alpha software. We encourage you to experiment, and expect some bugs!

For the time being we have added ourselves as a controller for your canister so we can push fixes and upgrade you to the final version of the software in the future. Having controller access means we have *complete control* over the canister. For this reason, we have not built any good ways to sell Bunchd NFTs. This will be a future addition once we remove ourselves as controllers. 

## Getting Started

We need three pieces of information from you

### Contract Name & Symbol

Integrators might use these for display purposes in applications.

For example, Bunchd might create a contract with the following:
- Bunchd NFTs
- BCHD

### UserId

Your can get your userId after [logging in here](https://xe5ii-jiaaa-aaaaf-qaaya-cai.raw.ic0.app/nft/admin). An example userid is shown in the picture below.

Once you've compiled all this information fill out [the following form](https://forms.gle/WuX7FwviMHVvw3RZ6) and we'll be in touch with your canister id!
